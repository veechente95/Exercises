# Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers

# Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.
# Given 1: number1 = 20 and number2 = 30. The Expected Output should be 600
# Given 2: number1 = 40 and number2 = 30. The Expected Output should be 70

def multiplication_or_sum(num1, num2):
    # calculate product of two number
    product = num1 * num2
    # check if product is less then 1000
    if product <= 1000:
        return product
    else:
        # product is greater than 1000 calculate sum
        return num1 + num2

# first condition
result = multiplication_or_sum(20, 30)
print("The result is", result)

# Second condition
result = multiplication_or_sum(40, 30)
print("The result is", result)

ðŸ‘‹Hello! Iâ€™m @veechente95. I'm a self-taught python developer seeking to launch a career as a software engineer in the world of tech. Iâ€™m currently learning how to code using bootcamps and other online resources. 

As a first generation Mexican-American self-taught python developer, I acknowledge the lack of diversity in traditional STEM fields and want to break the stigma by providing a diverse open door for future POC and Latinx folks coming from different communities, backgrounds and technical abilities. I want to use my story to help guide others who may have also experienced similar cases of imposter syndrome. Iâ€™m looking forward to developing impactful projects and taking the time to collaborate with others who are passionate about their work.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email vicenteceja123@gmail.com

Thanks!

# Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
# Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
# For example:
# remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
# remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.
# Note: n must be less than the length of the string

def remove_chars(word, n):
    print("Original String:", word)
    x = word[n:]
    return x

print("Removing characters from string")
print(remove_chars('pynative', 4))
print(remove_chars("pynative", 2))
